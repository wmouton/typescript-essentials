## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language(think of it as a superset of JavaScript) that was developed by Microsoft to address issues and shortcomings of JavaScript. TypeScript is a programming language that is built on top of JavaScript, think of it as a superset of JavaScript.

## Do we need it? Why?

We absolutely neet TypeScript because it adds additional features on top of JavaScript.

Benefits:

- Refactoring
- Code completion
- Shorthand notations
- Statically typed
- more...

This allows us to build slalable and robust web application faster than we normally would with plain(vanilla) JavaScript.

Let's cover a bit of what this means...

There are two types of programming languages, "statically typed" and "dynamically typed" languages.

| Statically-Typed | Dynamically Typed |
|---|---|
|Java, C++, C# | Python, JavaScript, Ruby|
|We identify the type of variables during compile time or while we write code.|We can|
|:x: :hand: What we can't do in C: |:thumbsup: What we can do in JavaScript | 
|int number = 10;<br>number = "a";|let number = 10;<br>number = "a"; |
